# AML HW2

## Important temporary notes:

this assignment was done by me before the deadline on a dataset, that I annotated manually, however  I’m unsatisfied because of that and because of the fact that I had to use yolov8x (the largest model ). So I decided to redo it. However Google collab limited my access to gpu, so I’m not able to finish it on time. I’ll proceed on it as it’ll return me access.

## Files

Right now you can find the previous solution for this assignment and some information on the cool way to annotate data in the report. also there are 2 jupiter notebooks in github for the training Mask RCNN and yolov8x. The 3rd one is for annotating data

All steps of the work are described in the report

Files for training models on the 3rd dataset will be added later
